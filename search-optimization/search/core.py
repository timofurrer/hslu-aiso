    A to B,  and an edge of length 2 from A to C.  You can also do:

    stays undirected; if you add more links with g.connect('B', 'C', 3), then
    inverse link is also added.  You can use g.nodes() to get a list of nodes,
    g.get('A') to get a dict of links out of A, and g.get('A', 'B') to get the
