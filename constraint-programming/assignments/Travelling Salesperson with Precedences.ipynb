    "Our industry partner is a Swiss small to medium sized company in the electricity market. They have one central headquarter from where they send out teams for various repair and maintenance tasks. Every task is bound to a specific location. The company wants to minimize the overall travelling costs. For simplicity we assume that the costs between any pair of locations are known in advance. However, they additionally have to respect certain inter-dependencies among the tasks. For example: for safety reasons it is important to first switch off electricity (task A) before starting the repair work on electric components (task B). This induces a constraint that task A must always be completed before task B can be started. \n",
    "\n",
    "Write a constraint optimization model based on the OR-Tools Routing API that takes the number of teams as input together with a costs matrix between any pair of locations. For testing we provide code that automati-cally creates cost matrices with random numbers. The following figure displays the inter-dependencies among 11 tasks to be worked off. We further assume that location 0 (not displayed here) refers to the company’s headquarter. The duration for each tasks can be considered a constant and can thus be neglected in your model.\n",
